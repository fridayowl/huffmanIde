Version 0.1 : Focus on  solving developers problems of coding or code traversal and making changes 

Version 1 Sepreating functions and class and creating connections:  
        - single file -> class and function flow 

Version 2 Implementing ide: 
        single file 
        python ide for editing the file 
        class and function flow 

Version 2.1  Controlling flows from  ide :
        single file 
        python ide 
            show button to disable and show the flows  @done
        class flow 
            button to show or disable function flows   @done 

Version 2.2 Dynamic flow generation-
        single file 
        python ide 
            refresh button
        blocks 
            -make the blocks ide friendly           
        bugs fixed :
            -function name contains underscore it is not considering that

Version 2.3 Connecting ide with flow blocks-
        single file 
        -connecting ide with classes  @done
        -connecting ide with functions outside the scope of the class  @done
        Canvas 
            - adding zoom in and zoom out and dragable functionality to the canvas  @done
            - when block are at the edges make zoom out automatically or find a way to make it better @later  
            
        Bugs Identified  : 
            Fixing ide focus out  



Version 2.4 Smoothing IDE  and Connection  and Customizaton -
        single file  
        -Changing code block connection color  @done
        -Making the positions more ordered  @done
        - Fixing code block out side the class  @done
        -Making a json file for the customising each connectors color and functionality   @done
        Bugs to fix : 
            -Ide focus out when the text changes 
            - customization not working for ide @done 
            -Zoom in and Zoom out automaticaly when the file loads(or something better @done
        Bugs Identified  :  
            -customization not workign for canvas @moved to next verion


Version  2.5 : Improvment on the blocks creation and program strucuturing 
        Single file  
        - Imporove setting pannel UI  @done
        -type: 'class' | 'class_function' | 'code' | 'class_standalone' | 'standalone_function'; change code to stand_alone_code @done
        add's
        Bugs to fix : 
            -Fix standalone functions not connecting with ide  
            - Fix customization not working for the canvas  @moved 


working 2.6 - Closing functions for single file 
        Single file 
        - Idenfy the standalone code inside a class 
            @done
        - Identify the standalone code and functions seperatly  @done
        - Fix the connectors not moving as desired  @done
        - Set the zoom level to 70% 
        -Fix setting unique id for the blocks rather than the function name or code name



Version 2.7 - Setting Connectors exact line of the ide  and also make this blocks smaller and compact 
            - add a directory viewer  @done 
            - make the block much more simpler and easy to view @done
            -save last opened folder and last save settings folderview / file type @moved
            - gesture zoom in and zoom out on canvas @moved
            - order the function and standalone code based on the line number  @done
            - passing line number to the blocks @done 
            - connectors comming from the line numbers rater than the block headers @done
            Bug 
            - for some reason  class stand alone codes are starting from ide not from class  @done
            - fix when class hide is cliked it should hide the class standalone @done
           

        Notes 👍
            connector end should be invisible 
            ide to block workig fine but the all the sub connected also should invisible 
            subblock to class bloack  both first block and second block is getting invisible
            ---
            What i have to do is now make sure the class standalone is treated as class sub nodes 
            ---
            Now the conenctor to class stand alone is not disappering
