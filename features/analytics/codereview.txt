Hardcoded token is a significant security risk. Sensitive information should always be securely managed.
Score: 10/25
Flexibility & Environment Management (25% weight)

The use of environment variables is a good practice. However, relying on defaults for critical fields (like token) reduces flexibility.
Score: 18/25

The code is simple and readable but lacks error handling and logging. Adding these would improve maintainability and traceability.
Score: 15/20
