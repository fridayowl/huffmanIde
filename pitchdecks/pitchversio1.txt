**Notes on competitors:**
- GitHub: Strong in version control and collaboration, but lacks advanced code analysis and AI features.
- GitLab: Offers a more comprehensive DevOps platform, but AI capabilities and code intelligence are limited.
- Atlassian (Bitbucket/Jira): Strong in project management and issue tracking, but less integrated for code analysis and AI assistance.
